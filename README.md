# works - some suggestions for learning some things

The files in [`resources/`](resources/) are the most useful.

Each stanza in [`resources/works-c++.md`](resources/works-c++.md) identifies
one or more (mostly short) works about C++, typically by the same author, that
are valuable and that are extremely closely related to each other. Different
works by the same author will most often appear in separate stanzas. Each
stanza is intended as a single recommendation. This is the most useful file in
the repository. But please note that this file has not been updated recently;
in particular, it does not have information about C++20.

[`resources/sh-resources.md`](resources/sh-resources.md) is a fairly
disorganized list of useful resources for learning and doing shell scripting.
It includes commentary. Perhaps more than necessary.

Files in [`commands/`](commands/) list some commonly present commands on
Unix-like OSes, especially GNU/Linux systems, and especially Debian and Ubuntu.
They are grouped by how valuable I think it might be to learn those commands
(so, for example,
[`commands/essential-commands.txt`](commands/essential-commands.txt) are the
ones I suggest may be most useful to learn about early on). I think these are
the least useful files in this repository; I intend them as loose suggestions,
and not as recommendations.
