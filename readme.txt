The files in resources/ are the most useful.

Each stanza in resources/works-c++.txt identifies one or more (mostly short)
works about C++, typically by the same author, that are valuable and that are
extremely closely related to each other. Different works by the same author
will most often appear in separate stanzas. Each stanza is intended as a single
recommendation. This is the most useful file in the repository. But please note
that this file has not been updated recently; in particular, it does not have
information about C++20.

resources/sh-resources.txt is a fairly disorganized list of useful resources
for learning and doing shell scripting. It includes commentary. Perhaps more
than necessary.

Files in commands/ list some commonly present commands on Unix-like OSes,
especially GNU/Linux systems, and especially Debian and Ubuntu. They are
grouped by how valuable I think it might be to learn those commands (so, for
example, essential-commands.txt are the ones I suggest may be most useful to
learn about early on). I think these are the least useful files in this
repository; I intend them as loose suggestions, and not as recommendations.
