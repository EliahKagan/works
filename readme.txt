Each stanza in works-c++.txt identifies one or more works, typically by the
same author, that are valuable and that are extremely closely related to each
other. Different works by the same author will most often appear in separate
stanzas. Each stanza is intended as a single recommendation.

sh-resources.txt is a fairly disorganized list of useful resources for learning
and doing shell scripting. It includes commentary. Perhaps more than necessary.
