Each stanza in works-c++.txt identifies one or more works, typically by the
same author, that are valuable and that are extremely closely related to each
other. Different works by the same author will most often appear in separate
stanzas. Each stanza is intended as a single recommendation.

sh-resources.txt is a fairly disorganized list of useful resources for learning
and doing shell scripting. It includes commentary. Perhaps more than necessary.

Files named like *-commands.txt list some commonly present commands on
Unix-like OSes, especially GNU/Linux systems, and especially Debian and Ubuntu.
They are grouped by how valuable I think it might be to learn those commands
(so, for example, essential-commands.txt are the ones I suggest may be most
useful to learn about early on.)
